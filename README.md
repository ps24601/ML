# ML
This is a collection of notebooks to perform Sentiment Analysis on IMDB dataset. 
1. Notebook1: This involves preprocessing of data and making it ready for applying the models.
2. Notebook2: This code block is for appying the statistical model like SVM and others on Sentiment analysis using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. Notebook3: Implementation of Bi-LSTM model for Sentiment analysis. Some of the main actions we perform here include, grid search on params, usage of Recitified Adam (which implements warm-up initial start), Bi-LSTM with and without skip connections.
4. Notebook4: Implementation of Pretrained embedding like glove(twitter), glove200d.
5. Notebook5: Implementation using Fasttext
6. Notebook6: Implementation of Transformers (BERT)
