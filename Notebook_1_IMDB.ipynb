    "# Sentiment classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of classifying sentiments of texts (for example movie or product reviews) has high practical significance in online marketing as well as financial prediction. This is a non-trivial task, since the concept of sentiment is not easily captured. We will use [IMDB sentiment](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) benchmark dataset from Stanford.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try out multiple models namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TFIDF + classical statistical model\n",
    "2. LSTM classification model\n",
    "3. LSTM model, where the embeddings are initialized with pre-trained word vectors\n",
    "4. fastText model\n",
    "5. BERT based model"
